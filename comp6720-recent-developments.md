# Recent developments
1. Time-aware interactive experience
The work uses real-time video processing technology to create a time-delay video, creating an interactive interface that supports emotional expression, allowing the audience to directly communicate with their past selves. This technical application reflects the innovative exploration of the time dimension in contemporary digital art and the latest application of computer vision technology in artistic creation.

2. Integration of emotional computing
Visualizing emotions and memories through the dynamic changes of particle systems shows how to transform complex computational models (Perlin noise) into emotionally resonant visual experiences. This reflects the development potential of emotional computing in interactive art.

3. Deep integration of emotion and art and interactive computing
Using art as a carrier, and through human-computer interaction methods such as real-time emotions of visual feedback and dynamic emotional responses based on user input, the project leads people into a deep field of exploring their inner selves, transforming personal memories and emotional experiences into interactive digital forms, and realizing the theme of entangled reality. This reflects the latest development area of art and computing - emotion in art and interaction computing.
