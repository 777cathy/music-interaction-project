Entangled Reality is an interactive audiovisual project exploring the subtle entanglement between people, memory, time, and past selves. Built with p5.js, it guides users through six immersive scenes—from ticking clocks to flowing memories and delayed self-reflection—each driven by sound, visuals, and user interaction. Through layered storytelling and emotional depth, the project invites audiences to reflect on their connection with time, identity, and reality.
