# Entangled Reality

**Entangled Reality** is an interactive digital artwork that explores the complex and delicate entanglement between people, time, memory, and past selves. Created using p5.js, the project offers a six-scene narrative experience that blends audiovisual storytelling and user interaction.

## Project Concept

The journey begins with a ticking clock, awakening the audience’s perception of time. As users interact by clicking, they move through a series of scenes:

1. **Ticking Clock Scene** – Symbolizes the constant passage of time.
2. **Reversing Hourglass** – Visualizes time flowing backward, drawing users into their past.
3. **Old Photo Scene** – Old photos ripple gently, evoking memories with each click.
4. **Flow Field Scene** – Visualizes emotional fluidity and memory using dynamic flow fields. Interaction via keyboard and mouse reveals diverse emotional states.
5. **Transition Scene** – A short visual interlude.
6. **Delayed Video Scene** – Users see themselves from moments earlier, creating a dialogue between present and past selves. They can also type messages to their past self, which later reappear in floating text form.

## Goals

The work invites reflection on:
- The relationship between self and time
- The nature of memory and identity
- The poetic complexity of our entangled realities

## Technologies Used

- **p5.js**
- Custom audio and image assets
- JavaScript OOP for scene control
