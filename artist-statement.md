# Artist Statement
The theme of my project is Entangled Reality, which is presented through the subtle and complex entanglement between people, time, memory and past selves. The project takes the audience on a journey through time and space and into the depths of the self through six progressive interactive scenes.

The project begins with a ticking clock, awakening the audience's initial perception of the past through this eternal symbol of time. By clicking the mouse, people could gradually get the theme of the project and enter the second scene. The ever-changing background and the reverse flow of the hourglass show the reverse flow of time, taking people back to the past. Then, with old photos as background, the ripples of memory gradually appear with the mouse clicking. The flow field scene presents after the ripples of memory, which visualizes the fluidity of memory and the diversity of emotions. People can explore memories of different emotions in their minds through the interaction of keyboard and mouse.

After the transition scene, there is a delayed video scene, which allows people to see their past selves in this video. The self-dialogue brought by the time difference creates a unique space for reflection. Meanwhile, the audience can use the keyboard to record what they want to say to their past selves, and these words will then reappear in a floating form, becoming a poetic footnote to this journey.

Through this multi-layered interactive experience, the project let audience feel the entangled reality, that is, the entanglement between people and the reality in the past and memory, and guides people to think about the relationship between themselves and their past selves, themselves and time, and themselves and the reality, and then to be inspired.
